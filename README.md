### Notes on vue iview
In this branch I am learning about additional toolkit iview

### Install plugin and package
In vue cli 3 you can install plugins after the project has been set up.  The naming convention of the plugin is vue-cli-plugin-NAME_OF_PLUGIN.  To install the plugin you simply can run vue add NAME_OF_PLUGIN.  For example for vue-cli-plugin-iview I ran **vue add iview**.

Then you install the iview package and include the js and css files mentioned in the iview documentation.

In the App.js I test out the different features available in iview.
